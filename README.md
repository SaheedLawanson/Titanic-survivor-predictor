# About the project

This project is a Machine learning project that predicts with 79% accuracy, a person's survival status based on certain features like cabin, sex, age etc. Running the project automatically creates two files:

1. A survived.csv file containing the results from a the test data found in the "Titanic data set" folder.

2. A log_model.sav file which is simply the model saved to a file, so we don't have to run the script whenever we need to use the model.

# Built with:
